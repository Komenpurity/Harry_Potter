A NextJs application that displays harry potter characters with their details.

## Setup and Installation

* Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone git@github.com:Komenpurity/Harry_Potter.git

## Deliverables

* Display a list of Harry Potter characters in the card element on the
homepage. Show their name and Date of Birth from the API data.

* When a user clicks on the card, navigate to a details page that displays more
information about that character, such as their name, role, house, wand, etc.
This information should also be retrieved from the API.

* The app should have a search functionality that allows the user to search
for a specific character by name or house. The search results should be
displayed in the card list..

* Use TailwindCSS to style the app and make it look appealing and consistent.
Use responsive design techniques(mobile first) to make the app work well on
different devices and orientations.

* Remember to make your commit to github, you can work on other
branches and create pull requests to the main branch.
